Technology: This project is application by using JavaFX + CSS + FXML.

Local Messenger
For this project, you need to develop a local messenger system simulating an online chatting
application, such as Yahoo messenger or Skype. Two windows are created locally to mimic a
remote conversation scenario. We assume these two windows represent two friends’ user
interfaces. They communicate to each other through the windows. Each window has a basic
user typing area to send message out to the friend. A history panel locates on the top of the
window for users to view dialog records. The layout is shown as below:
While this is just an example layout, you have the freedom to change the layout as you like, as
long as is user friendly and making sense. However, your layout should have three components.

● For the user typing area, you can use the “font size” drop list to change the font size as
needed, e.g. “1”, “2”, “3”, … ,”6”. You can use 6 different arbitrary sizes to change the
font size of your typed message. (10%)
● For the user typing area, you can use the “font color” drop list to change the color of the
typed message. Here you can also provide 6 or more different color options. You can
simply use String text to represent the color option, e.g. “red”, “silver”, … But if you want
to make it cooler, you can use color icon for the drop list, which requires your more
effort. But this feature is not compulsory. (10%)
● You can choose the style “drop list” to change the main color theme for your window.
(10%)
● Every time when a user send a new message (by clicking the “send” button), this
message should be shown simultaneously on the history panel for both windows. (25%)
● On the history panel, each message should be separated by a new row. The format of
each message is flexible, but should contain the following information
